##  Read-Me Generator

# Description

This node.js created application prompts users for input to generate a read-me file in markdown. It is invoked through the computer terminal, and all user questions are answered through the promps given in the terminal. When all prompts are finished being answered, a readme file is created specific to the inputs and is found in the "dist" folder.

# Usage
This is used to create readme files for users about project information and other types of instructions. 

# Technologies
Javascripts and node.js make up the functionality of this project, along with the inquirer package for command line prompts.

# Future Development

Adding more user prompts to create a more descriptive read me, with options to skip sections or create new sections for a customizable readme file.

# Walkthrough
See this link for how to invoke the application and generate a user-specific readme.
